Welcome to Zeref and Alen's new project!
Both the macros and the modules are ready to be used. In the upcoming days, we'll write the documentation for the macros.
After that, we'll focus on explaining the ILL module with documentation and examples.

If you have questions, advice, requests, or anything to say, please do.
We hope that ILL can become a community project and not just a module of two people.
For that, we need a lot feedback, both from users and macro developers.

About ILL...
ILL is a module that eases the creation of macros. It can be compared to two of the most commonly used libraries: AssFoundation and Yutils.
Currently, the macros that use ILL are primarily designed for handling shapes, so ILL may be a bit immature for managing subtitles.

That's all for now. Be sure to check the documentation when it comes out!
